	 * buffer here. This one is a slow path helper and intended
	 * for replies with control messages.
	 *
	 * Like in bpf_skb_change_proto(), we want to keep this rather
	 * minimal and without protocol specifics so that we are able
	 * to separate concerns as in bpf_skb_store_bytes() should only
	 * be the one responsible for writing buffers.
	 *
	 * It's really expected to be a slow path operation here for
	 * control message replies, so we're implicitly linearizing,
	 * uncloning and drop offloads from the skb by this.
